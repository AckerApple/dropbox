# named-drag-drop

Example of Mac enabled drag/drop to activate NodeJs.

Rename both the test.app and test.js to a matching name that better fits your needs. The app and NodeJs file must be named the same, file extensions do not matter.

Example: Drop a file on the test.app. A file of almost the same name will be written with the contents being the path back to the original file. You can even drop this read me file on that test.app
